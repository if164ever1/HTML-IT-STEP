    <h2>Romeo and Juliet</h2>
    <p><b>ACT1</b></p>
    <p><b>PROLOGUE</b></p>
    <p class="text">
      Romeo and Juliet begins as the Chorus introduces two feuding families of
      Verona: the Capulets and the Montagues. On a hot summer's day, the young
      men of each faction fight until the Prince of Verona intercedes and
      threatens to banish them. Soon after, the head of the Capulet family plans
       a feast. His goal is to introduce his daughter Juliet to a Count named
       Paris who seeks to marry Juliet.

      Montague's son Romeo and his friends (Benvolio and Mercutio) hear of the
      party and resolve to go in disguise. Romeo hopes to see his beloved
      Rosaline at the party. Instead, while there, he meets Juliet and falls
      instantly in love with her. Juliet's cousin Tybalt recognises the Montague
       boys and forces them to leave just as Romeo and Juliet discover one
       another.
